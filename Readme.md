# Thyroid Recurrence Prediction

This project implements machine learning models to predict the recurrence of thyroid conditions in patients based on clinical data. It compares the performance of **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifiers to determine the most effective model for this medical diagnostic task.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the target variable **Recurred (Yes/No)** based on patient attributes.  
- **Models Implemented:**  
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- **Best Performing Model:**  
  - **Decision Tree** (Accuracy: ~97.4%, Recall: 95%)  
- **Key Techniques:** Mode Imputation, Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)

---

##  Dataset

The project uses the `filtered_thyroid_data.csv` dataset, which contains patient records with the following attributes:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender  
- **Medical History:** Hx Radiotherapy, Adenopathy  
- **Pathology:** Pathology type, Focality, Risk  
- **Staging:** T, N, M, Stage  
- **Outcome:** Response, **Recurred (Target Variable)**

##  Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/Bini-fish/Thyroid_Recurrence_Prediction.git
cd thyroid-recurrence-prediction
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Prepare Data: Ensure `filtered_thyroid_data.csv` is located in the data/ directory.

Run the Analysis: Execute the main script:
- `Thyroid.ipynb`

# Results Summary

| Model         | Accuracy | Precision (Recurred) | Recall (Recurred) | F1-Score |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Decision Tree | 97.40%   | 0.95                 | 0.95              | 0.95     |
| KNN (K=5)     | 94.81%   | 1.00                 | 0.79              | 0.88     |

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree was selected as the superior model. Although KNN achieved perfect precision, the Decision Tree provided a significantly higher recall rate (0.95 vs 0.79), meaning it is much better at identifying actual recurrence cases
