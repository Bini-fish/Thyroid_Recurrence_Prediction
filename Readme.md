Thyroid Recurrence PredictionThis project implements machine learning models to predict the recurrence of thyroid conditions in patients based on clinical data. It compares the performance of Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers.📊 Project OverviewObjective: Predict Recurred (Yes/No) based on attributes like Age, Gender, Pathology, and Treatment History.Models Used: Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).Best Model: Decision Tree (Accuracy: ~97.4%, Recall: 95%).📂 DatasetThe dataset (filtered_thyroid_data.csv) contains patient records including:Demographics: Age, GenderMedical History: Hx Radiotherapy, AdenopathyPathology: Pathology type, Focality, Risk, T/N/M stagingOutcome: Response, Recurred (Target)⚙️ InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/thyroid-recurrence-prediction.git](https://github.com/yourusername/thyroid-recurrence-prediction.git)
cd thyroid-recurrence-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 UsageEnsure the dataset is in the data/ folder.Run the main script:python src/main.py
The script will output the accuracy scores and classification reports for both models in the console.📈 Results SummaryModelAccuracyPrecision (Recurred)Recall (Recurred)Decision Tree97.40%0.950.95KNN (K=5)94.81%1.000.79The Decision Tree was selected as the superior model due to its high recall rate, which is critical for medical diagnostics to minimize false negatives.📄 DocumentationFor a detailed analysis of the preprocessing steps, methodology, and observations, please refer to the Project Report.👤 Author[Your Name]
